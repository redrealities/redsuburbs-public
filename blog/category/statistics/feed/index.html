<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Methodology</h2>



<p>For this research we took single most dangerous suburb from each LGA in Sydney Metro Area. This may mean that if some LGA has large number of dangerous suburbs, some of them maybe omitted. At the same time this approach, prevent overly focusing on a single LGA and paints a more diverse risk picture. We may change our methodology in future years to increase accuracy and value of data. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Sydney Safety Tips: How To Stay Safe and avoid Trouble</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Be mindful of your belongings:</strong> In crowded places like public transport, restaurants, and shopping centres, stay vigilant about your belongings, particularly valuables such as backpacks, wallets, and mobile phones.</li>



<li><strong>Limit carrying cash:</strong> Opt to pay with bank cards and avoid carrying large amounts of cash. If carrying cash is necessary, distribute it across different locations for added security.</li>



<li><strong>Travel with companions:</strong> Whenever possible, travel with friends or companions, especially at night. Avoid walking alone in unfamiliar or isolated areas.</li>



<li><strong>Select safe transportation options:</strong> For nighttime travel, prioritise using public transport or ride-hailing services like Uber or taxis instead of walking. On public transport, try to sit near the driver or other passengers.</li>



<li><strong>Steer clear of high-risk areas:</strong> While Sydney is generally safe, some remote or outlying areas may pose a higher risk at night. It&#8217;s best to avoid these regions.</li>



<li><strong>Avoid empty train or bus carriages:</strong> When traveling at night, choose carriages or sections with more passengers or sit closer to the driver for added safety.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you rent or plan to buy it is important to know crime situation in your target area. These are top 5 Brisbane crime suburbs and their detailed statistics.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://redsuburbs.com.au/suburbs/brisbane-city" data-type="URL" data-id="https://redsuburbs.com.au/suburbs/brisbane-city">Brisbane CBD &#8211; Crime Rank 100</a></h2>



<p><strong>Population:</strong> 9460<br><strong>Total Crimes:</strong> 8391</p>



<p>Largest by population the Brisbane CBD area is also highest in crime. Yearly cases of theft, disorderly &amp; offensive conduct and drug offences are in thousands. With high activity and cultural life in the area high crime comes as well.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://redsuburbs.com.au/suburbs/brisbane-city"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="912" height="533" src="https://redsuburbs.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/brisbane-graph.png" alt="Brisbane crimes: Theft - 2924, Disorderly and offensive conduct - 1671, Drug dealing and trafficking - 1108.

<p><strong>Population:</strong> 6978<br><strong>Total Crimes:</strong> 5275</p>



<p>This is only suburb in our top 5 that has disorderly &amp; offensive conduct higher than theft. This is most probably related to famous night life of Fortitude Valley. Sadly night life also creates crimes, often in intoxicated state.</p>

<p>South Brisbane area while still have Theft as prime category of crime also has particularly large share of drug related offences. Break and entry category also has larger share.
