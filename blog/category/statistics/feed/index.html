<p>If you rent or plan to buy it is important to know crime situation in your target area. These are top 5 Brisbane crime suburbs and their detailed statistics.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://redsuburbs.com.au/suburbs/brisbane-city" data-type="URL" data-id="https://redsuburbs.com.au/suburbs/brisbane-city">Brisbane CBD &#8211; Crime Rank 100</a></h2>



<p><strong>Population:</strong> 9460<br><strong>Total Crimes:</strong> 8391</p>



<p>Largest by population the Brisbane CBD area is also highest in crime. Yearly cases of theft, disorderly &amp; offensive conduct and drug offences are in thousands. With high activity and cultural life in the area high crime comes as well.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://redsuburbs.com.au/suburbs/brisbane-city"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="912" height="533" src="https://redsuburbs.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/brisbane-graph.png" alt="Brisbane crimes: Theft - 2924, Disorderly and offensive conduct - 1671, Drug dealing and trafficking - 1108.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://redsuburbs.com.au/suburbs/fortitude-valley" data-type="URL" data-id="https://redsuburbs.com.au/suburbs/fortitude-valley">Fortitude Valley &#8211; Crime Rank 93</a></h2>



<p><strong>Population:</strong> 6978<br><strong>Total Crimes:</strong> 5275</p>



<p>This is only suburb in our top 5 that has disorderly &amp; offensive conduct higher than theft. This is most probably related to famous night life of Fortitude Valley. Sadly night life also creates crimes, often in intoxicated state.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://redsuburbs.com.au/suburbs/bowen-hills">South Brisbane &#8211; Crime Rank 52</a></h2>



<p><strong>Population:</strong> 3226<br><strong>Total Crimes:</strong> 1141</p>



<p>South Brisbane area while still have Theft as prime category of crime also has particularly large share of drug related offences. Break and entry category also has larger share. This area while providing large number of cultural and entertainment events obviously has it&#8217;s share of problems.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://redsuburbs.com.au/suburbs/bowen-hills"><img decoding="async" width="885" height="549" src="https://redsuburbs.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/bowen-hills.png" alt="Bowen Hills crimes: Theft - 439, Drug dealing and trafficking - 258, Burglary/Break and enter - 85, Disorderly an offensive conduct - 82.

<p><strong>Population:</strong> 7196<br><strong>Total Crimes:</strong> 2345</p>



<p>With similar picture to others in our top 5 of Brisbane crime suburbs, it has differences. Most important to notice significantly larger share of assaults and related offences in Bowen Hills. This can be a red flag for renting in the area and signal that is it not family friendly.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://redsuburbs.com.au/suburbs/south-brisbane"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="853" height="533" src="https://redsuburbs.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/south-briss.png" alt="South Brisbane crimes: Theft - 910, Drug dealing and trafficking - 314, Disorderly and offensive conduct - 302, Assault and related offences - 183, Burglary/Break and enter - 168." class="wp-image-29" srcset="https://redsuburbs.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/south-briss.png 853w, https://redsuburbs.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/south-briss-300x187.png 300w, https://redsuburbs.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/south-briss-650x406.png 650w, https://redsuburbs.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/south-briss-768x480.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 853px) 100vw, 853px" /></a></figure>

<p><strong>Population:</strong> 5631<br><strong>Total Crimes:</strong> 1575</p>



<p>The primary highlight for Woolloongabba crime is very large share of break and enter crimes #3 and other property damage crimes #4. This can be a red flag for property ownership in that suburb.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://redsuburbs.com.au/suburbs/woolloongabba"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="869" height="541" src="https://redsuburbs.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/woolloongabba.png" alt="Woolloongabba crimes: Theft - 663, Drug dealing and trafficking - 204, Burglary/Break and enter - 164, Property damage - 110, Assault and related offences - 94." class="wp-image-32" srcset="https://redsuburbs.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/woolloongabba.png 869w, https://redsuburbs.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/woolloongabba-300x187.png 300w, https://redsuburbs.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/woolloongabba-650x405.png 650w, https://redsuburbs.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/woolloongabba-768x478.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /></a></figure>
