<h2>1. <a href="https://www.realestate.com.au/" rel="nofollow">RealEstate.com.au</a></h2>



<p><strong><em>Find and filter houses or apartments by suburb or on a map.</em></strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default img--shadow-border"><img decoding="async" width="650" height="377" src="//redsuburbs.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/realestate-650x377.jpg" alt="RealEstate.com.au front page with tools for property search" class="wp-image-197"/></figure>



<p>RealEstate.com.au is Australia&#8217;s largest and most popular property search website. You can find most property listings on it. While best used for property search it has some basic research tools. </p>



<p>Suburb Profiles can give a quick overview before deeper research. Address Search can give minimal information about a specific property and its history.</p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
</div></div>



<div class="is-layout-flow wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>2. <a href="https://www.domain.com.au/" rel="nofollow">Domain.com.au</a></h2>

<p>Domain.com.au is the second-largest property search website in Australia. It works very like its competitor RealEstate.com.au but may have fewer property listings. </p>



<p>Like RealEstate.com.au it also has basic property research tools.</p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
</div></div>



<div class="is-layout-flow wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>3. <a href="https://www.realestateview.com.au/" rel="nofollow">RealEstateView.com.au</a></h2>

<p>RealEstateView.com.au is the third largest property website in Australia. It has fewer features than RealEstate.com.au or Domain.com.au. With a focus on areas missed by other top property search sites, it also has good research tools.</p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<p>AllHomes.com.au is a #1 property search website in ACT and has most of its services focused on that region. While you can search properties in other states too, the results would be coming from Domain.com.au. Why? Because these websites belong to the same company.</p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
</div></div>



<div class="is-layout-flow wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">

<p>RealCommercial.com.au is the Australian most popular commercial real estate search website. It allows searching for properties to buy, lease or invest in. Other features are short-term office or event spaces and a high-quality news section.</p>



<p>RealCommercial.com.au has the same owners as RealEstate.com.au and shares part of its services.</p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
</div></div>



<div class="is-layout-flow wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">

<p>Commercial Real Estate has most services of RealCommercial.com.au and some more. You can buy, lease or invest in commercial property and find office or event space there. What&#8217;s more, you can buy an entire business or a franchise. Ever wanted your own Guzman Y Gomez? </p>



<p>Commercial Real Estate belongs to the same owners as Domain.com.au and shares some of its services.</p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<p>Sotheby&#8217;s International Realty lets you search for various luxury real estate. It is not Australia only, so prices are actually in US$. Here you can find unique places like castles, mansions, and whole islands. </p>



<p>Most places have &#8216;Price Upon Request&#8217; but some have a public price. You might find some of the places on common search sites, but Sotheby&#8217;s focused on a luxury audience.</p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
</div></div>



<div class="is-layout-flow wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>8. <a href="https://www.urban.com.au/" rel="nofollow">Urban.com.au</a></h2>



<p class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color has-background" style="background-color:#fcb90038"><strong>Notice! This is VIC focused resource.</strong></p>



<p><strong><em>Search for future and ongoing development projects.</em></strong></p>

<p>Urban.com.au is a great place to look for off-the-plan or not yet built properties. It is currently a Victoria-only resource. It has advanced search and filtering features, not only by location but also by the developer.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;d like to get onto the property as early as possible then this is your platform. You can find detailed property plans and also receive construction updates. All needed details to buy into it at the best moment.</p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
</div></div>



<div class="is-layout-flow wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>9. <a href="https://www.residz.com/" rel="nofollow">Residz</a></h2>



<p><strong><em>Search properties, find unique properties, and download a free property report.</em></strong></p>

<p>Residz is a rather small property search website when we compare it to the big 3. To compensate for its smaller size Residz offers some unique features. Free property research, internet connection check, bushfire risk, and flood risk are some. </p>



<p>You can see area crime stats as well, though they are a few years old. There are many more features, though the website feels less polished than the top 3.</p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<h2>10. <a href="https://www.salebyhomeowner.com.au/" rel="nofollow">SaleByHomeOwner.com.au</a></h2>



<p><strong><em>Search and filter properties listed by their owners.</em></strong></p>

<p>SaleByHomeOwner.com.au allows property owners to list, sell, and rent without commission. Needless to say that it is very different to negotiate with an agent or with an owner when you buy. </p>



<p>All these properties would be on the top 3 sites but would take extra effort to find. When the owner doesn&#8217;t need to pay a commission, there is a better chance to negotiate a lower price.</p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<div class="is-layout-flow wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">

<p>Commercial Property Guide is Australia&#8217;s number one independent commercial real estate website. The keyword is &#8211; independent, which means it doesn&#8217;t belong to RealEstate.com.au or Domain.com.au. How much value in it is for you to decide. </p>



<p>All standard features are present and work very fast, so let&#8217;s look at what makes it special. Commercial Property Guide is a guide that you can receive by email monthly. Also, there is a large Experts Directory that might help you find the right person for the job.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.yourinvestmentpropertymag.com.au/" rel="nofollow">Your Investment Property magazine</a> provides profiles with financial stats for all Australian suburbs. It also shows the top 10 suburbs for every state and territory. </p>



<p>Provided data sourced from <a href="https://www.corelogic.com.au/" rel="nofollow">CoreLogic</a> and <a href="https://dsrdata.com.au/" rel="nofollow">DSR Data</a>. It is usually outdated by a few months at least. The data is in a simple and concise format of charts and tables.</p>

<p>OnTheHouse.com.au allows you to search for properties, but their real value is in suburb profiles. Their free property research tools give simple financial and demographic overview. This high-level overview can help to decide on a suburb before diving deep.</p>

<p>SQM Research is a gold mine of free property research tools and some paid tools &amp; services as well. Some graphs visualise large data sets of 10 or even 25 years. </p>



<p>You can find household income, rental vacancy and rental yield graphs. And this is only a small subset of data available for free!</p>

<p>DSR Data provides you with the Demand to Supply Ratio, a predictor of capital growth potential. You need a free account to see DSR for specific suburbs. There are many more research tools but they need a paid subscription.</p>

<p>Suburb Trends has a wealth of information on it and dozens of region reports. The feature to highlight though is its Suburb Map with detailed suburb profiles. </p>



<p>With the usual data view, it also presents a plain text summary that can be easier to understand for some people. It also has unique features: building approvals, elevation and demographic profiles.</p>

<p>While many of HomeOn features need payment, the free suburb reports are full of useful data. It has a useful map view to compare nearby suburbs. The main issue is that it is available for Sydney only.</p>

<p>Heatmaps.com.au is an amazing free property research tool that is not very well known. It allows displaying different financial indicators on a heat map. That visual approach makes it very easy to compare and navigate. The data is on a post-code level, so it often includes more than one suburb. </p>



<p>Heatmaps has non-financial data layers as well, but they are basic or region-specific. For example, you can see crime stats for NSW only. And best &#8211; it is completely free!</p>
